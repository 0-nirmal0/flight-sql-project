# Flight Database SQL Project ✈️

## Overview  
This project analyzes a real-world **flight database** using PostgreSQL.  
It demonstrates **end-to-end SQL skills**: importing raw data, cleaning, writing queries, creating views, and extracting insights.  

The database is large (100MB+), making it a great simulation of real-world SQL work.
